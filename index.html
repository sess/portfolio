            <span>My name is Sergio Sanchez and I'm one of Jehovah's Witnesses, so I go door to door preaching regularly. My interests are web developing and designing, astronomy and a small amount of gaming on the side, to name a few. As of the moment I'm enrolled in a program called Code Nation who teach HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                  I'm currently in the second part of the curriculum, which is called the "Advanced Course".

                  I'm currently a student at Independence high school. I'm interested in looking for a job working with web designing and web developing because, for most of my life and up to now, I've always wanted to create something, and working with programming or coding languages to build a website is a really nice way to meet that.
                   In my free time I really love to be able to relax and not have to worry about, if not much, anything.

                  If your interested in seeing some of my work, click on the file icon in the navbar.
